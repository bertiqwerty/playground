# Private retirement provision calculator in Elm

Since private pension provision is currently an issue for us, I built a calculator as a 
mini test project. You pass the annual interest rate, the monthly savings rate, and the 
number of savings years and it spits out the account balance at the end of the savings 
period. Additionally, we have a calculator for a withdrawal plan.
